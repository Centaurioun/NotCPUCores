# NotCPUCores
Functionally the Same, but Free. Download under Releases

![Version 1.4.0.0](https://i.imgur.com/y54djgm.gif)

## This program does the same optimizations as the non-free CPUCores. These include:

* Changing the Process Priority
* Changing the Cores the Process runs on
* Stopping Unneeded Services while the game is running
* Setting the Power Plan to Max.
* Tweaking HPET (System Event Timers)

## Is it worth using NotCPUCores/CPUCores/(Insert Other Optimizer Here)?

Probably not, but you DEFINITELY should NOT be paying money for it. All these optimizers do simple tweaks that you yourself can do. You MAY see marginal returns, slightly better stability of FPS, but also more battery usage. There is SIMPLY NO REPLACEMENT for doing a hardware upgrade.

## Are you done yet?
