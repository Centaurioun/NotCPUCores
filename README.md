# NotCPUCores
The same, but free. Download under Releases

## HI! This project is currently on the backburner as I've taken on more responsibilities at work! Got a bug report or feature request? Create a issue using the tab above and I'll get on it when I can. Minor feature requests and bug reports will likely be added as soon as I see them. Larger requests be delayed. Warmest Regards - Robert M.

![Version 1.1.0.0 - Not Too Pretty Right now, but working on](http://i.imgur.com/wbDL8nq.png)

## This program does the same optimizations as the non-free CPUCores. These include:

* Changing the Process Priority
* The Cores the game runs on
* Stopping Unneeded Services while the game is running
* Setting the Power Plan to Max.
* Tweaking HPET (System Event Timers)

## Is it worth using NotCPUCores/CPUCores/(Insert Other Optimizer Here)?

Probably not, but you DEFINITELY should NOT be paying money for it. All these optimizers do simple tweaks that you yourself can do. You MAY see marginal returns, slightly better stability of FPS, but also more battery usage. There is SIMPLY NO REPLACEMENT for doing a hardware upgrade.

## Are you done yet?
