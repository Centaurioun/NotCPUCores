Not in the IT field/Extremely Tech Literate? [Click here](https://github.com/rcmaehl/NotCPUCores/blob/master/FAQ.md)

Okay so yeah, Windows does system resource allocation pretty well, I mean they've been working on it since, what, the 70s? Windows has allowed manual resource allocation for quite some time but those who have the knowledge to do so generally do not need to do so. There are exceptions to this such as Virtual Machines and sandboxing, however that is not the purpose of NotCPUCores. NotCPUCores is designed to help the less technically inclined, or just the plain lazy, force or at least bias Windows into allocating resources towards where they need it most. I recently started working on streaming mode to be able to market towards a wider auduence. As you can see, I don't charge or include advertisements, so I don't make money off this program; NotCPUCores was made to help those who might get some benefit by using this program without charging them money, or withholding how it works. I'm sure I have a long way to go to work towards not being lumped in with other developers of similar software, but I'll try my best.
